# Pywren demo

1. Install pywren (e.g. `pip install pywren`). If you want to make the plot,
   install the rest of the requirements in requirements.txt (`e.g. pip install
   -r requirements.txt`)

2. Configure AWS credentials, e.g. set the appropriate environment variables or
   put them in `~/.aws/credentials`

3. Run `pywren-setup` and accept the defaults.

4. Launch the notebooks.

5. For a more complete demo, see the [pywren tutorial at the 2017
   risecamp](https://github.com/ucbrise/risecamp/tree/risecamp2017/pywren).
